The with statement ensures that the file object is properly closed after the block of code within the with statement has been executed. This ensures that resources are properly managed and freed up, even if an error occurs within the block of code.\n",

    "The advantage of using the with statement and open() together is that it provides a cleaner and more readable way to work with files. Instead of manually opening and closing the file, you can use the with statement to automatically close the file when the block of code has been executed. This makes your code more robust and easier to understand.\n",
